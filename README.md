### Mission

We want to...

* solve the issue of NFTs on Ethereum having to pay high gas prices to trade, even though there are more solutions such as L2 and sidechain.
* solve the fact that most NFTs are currently concentrated in Ethereum, making it difficult for the emerging chains to activate their NFT ecosystems.
* solve the problem of a closed ecosystem in the chain.

### Background

We challenged the Cross-chain NFT implementation using Connext at the ETHAmsterdam hackathon. We have kept developing since then.&#x20;

Previously, we had developed a multi-chain EVM NFT minting platform [Chocomint](https://factory.chocomint.app/).&#x20;

There are synergies between Chocomint and NFTHashi as well, and when the two combine well, it enables the users to create NFTs more flexibly unbounded by chains.

### Why Cross-Chain for NFT?

The increasing number of L2s and chains will lead to a fragmentation of users, data, and liquidity, and the importance of asset bridging will keep increasing.

Every blockchain product will move towards being able to support cross-chain use cases.

The cross-chain NFT market is currently untapped, with the potential to cross-pollinate multiple communities in every domain

Cross-chain NFTs are not yet common, but there is high potential for them.

* _Cross-chain NFT collections._
* _Cross-chain NFT marketplaces._
* Cross-chain NFT games
* _Cross-chain lending using NFTs as collateral._
* Cross-chain NFT governance

Cross-chain NFTs can find new use cases in NFTs that did not exist before.

### Why NFTHashi for Your NFT?

We use Connext, and Connext provides trust-minimized cross-chain messaging using optimistic verification provided by Nomad, the most trust-minimized protocol for cross-chain messaging so you can safely bridge your valuable NFTs!

Easily bridge your NFTs with our intuitive portal.

For creators, it is easy to create NFTs that are natively cross-chain by adding the NFTHashi SDK into the NFT contract.

NFTs that have already been issued can be bridged to other chains. That means your Punks or BAYC can go beyond Ethereum and can be used on any chain you like
