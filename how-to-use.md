#### Approve Transaction

If you have not approved the NFTHashi contract, it asks for approve transaction. This approval allows the NFTHashi contract takes your NFT to bridge. If NFTHashi is already approved, this process is skipped.

#### Bridge Transaction

This is the last part of the bridge. This transaction takes your NFT and lock it in NFTHashi, then NFTHashi send cross-chain messaging to destination chain, then NFT will be minted in destination chain.
